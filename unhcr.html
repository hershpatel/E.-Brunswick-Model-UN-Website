                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your director will be Ryan Josephson, a senior at East Brunswick High school. Ryan is a seasoned MUN veteran and has been to several Model United Nations and Model Congresses throughout the course of his career. Ryan not only does MUN/MC, but he is also involved in several other school organizations as well. He is the President of the school’s chapter of National Honor Society and is a board member on the East Brunswick Educational fund. Ryan hopes to use his MUN/MC experience and his people skills to make your committee as fun and educational as possible.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your two assistant directors will be Vasu Jain, a junior at East Brunswick High School, and Priyanka Patel a senior at the high school. Vasu has participated in MUN/MC since freshman year, but like Ryan, also participates in many other school activities. He spends his Saturdays playing Quiz Bowl and also participates in Mock Trial, FBLA, and German/Math/Science honor society. Priyanka is also a veteran at MUN/MC and has done it for all 4 years of high school. She enjoys dancing, a hobby she has been doing for 11 years, and likes to compete in science through Bio-League and Merck competitions. Both assistant directors hope to make the committee experience as best as possible.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since its conception in 1950, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has played a vital role in history such as by helping Rwandan and Somalian refugees. The committee aims to protect refugees by giving them asylum, or providing humanitarian aid and it currently operates in all major corners of the world. The topic that will be addressed in the committee is the rights of refugees.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The rights of refugees is an important topic and is one that is extremely relevant today. Refugees will always exist and they need to be given a greater degree of rights compared to what they are given today. Every type of nation needs to play an active role in addressing this problem. Poorer nations will have to find a way to allocate what resources they have to increase the rights of refugees while richer nations will have to find a way to swiftly address the problem, while being a model for other nations. We urge you to consider your nation’s policy, financial situation, and willingness to help refugees when finding unique solutions to this big problem.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are looking forward to holding a great committee. Please read the brief or email the chair if you have any questions. Look forward to seeing you there!</p>
