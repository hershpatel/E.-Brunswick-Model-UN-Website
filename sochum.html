                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your Director, Aisha Rashid, is a senior at East Brunswick High School, and has  been involved in Model UN since her sophomore year (when she was a SOCHUM delegate), participating in conferences including RUMUN, NAIMUN, and NHSMUN, as well as Rutgers Model Congress. Aside from MUN, Aisha is Editor-in-Chief of EBHS’s school newspaper, The Clarion, a first chair alto saxophone player, and an assistant editor for MuslimGirl.net. Aisha has also served as an editor on EBMUN’s Editor’s Board, and is devoted to helping new delegates and guiding them throughout their Model UN experience. Aisha is ecstatic to see what each of you have prepared and expects nothing but the best from her delegates!
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your Assistant Director, Adam Fink, is a senior at East Brunswick High School and has been involved in the Model UN program since sophomore year. He has been a delegate at 4 Model UN Conferences and 2 Model Congress Conferences. Outside of MUN, Adam is Regional Vice-President of Programming for BBYO (a Jewish youth group) and is involved with East Brunswick’s We The People Constitution team. Adam is looking forward to seeing what all of you have prepared and cannot wait to use his experience to help delegates tackle the issues at hand.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your other Assistant Director, Shirley Song, is a junior at East Brunswick High School. Involved in Model UN since her sophomore year, she has participated in 3 conferences including RUMUN and NHSMUN. In addition to MUN, Shirley is an avid writer and die-hard soccer fan who also enjoys playing quizbowl, participating in mock trial, and leading Perspectives, a gender equality club. She is eager to hear from and work with delegates in what is sure to be an educational and rewarding committee.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee of the United Nations has always focused on the examination of human rights. Currently in its 96th session, SOCHUM (as it’s commonly referred to as) deals with issues spanning from drug trafficking to indigenous people, which is the focus of this session. Indigenous Peoples worldwide number between 300-500 million, embody and nurture 80% of the world’s cultural and biological diversity, and occupy 20% of the world’s land surface. However, their lands have often been taken from them due to discriminatory government policies, and actions of private economic interests. They are often in the center of conflict for access to valuable resources because of where they live, or, in yet other cases, struggling to live the way they would like. There is not yet one definitive definition of Indigenous Peoples, but they are generally considered as those who inhabited a land before it was conquered by colonial societies and who consider themselves distinct from the societies currently governing those territories.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is a major achievement by Indigenous peoples in the face of state reluctance, and sometimes, active resistance, to address the issues contained in it. However, there is still much controversy surrounding it. The purpose of this committee is to create a potentially revised resolution, determining the rights of Indigenous Peoples and what the United Nations should do in ensuring that these individuals are given the rights that they are entitled to.</p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Make sure to go through the brief for important background information to get you started on your research and to email any of us if you have questions! Good luck with your preparation and we look forward to seeing you all ready for a great committee.</p>
