                                <b>Payment</b>
                                </br>Delegates coming as part of a delegation will be charged $25 per person, while delegates coming individually will be charged $30. For the purposes of payment, delegations will count as groups of five or more people. This will cover delegate costs as well as food costs. Payment will be required with a check made out to East Brunswick High School, either mailed in advance or handed in on the day of the tournament. If we do not have your payment by the date of the conference, <b>you will not be allowed to participate</b>. In case your school requires an invoice, please let us know by March 14th in order to give us sufficient notice. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Registration</b>
                                </br>Registration will be assigned in a modified first come, first serve basis. All delegations who submit requests prior to February 28th will receive priority, while those registering after will be assigned on a rolling basis. Keep in mind earlier registration is completed, the more time your delegates will have to prepare!
                            </p>
        
                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Moderators</b>
                                </br>All delegates/delegations will be required to have a chaperone present. This chaperone need not be a teacher or parent, but must be an adult 21 years or older. Moderators will be allowed to visit committees to observe delegates or relax in a lounge. Wi-Fi will be provided free of cost. For moderator purposes, any group of students will be counted as a delegation provided the adult takes responsibility for that group. For example, a group of three students will be required to only bring one moderator even though they'll be paying as individuals.
                            </p>

                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Conduct &amp; Discipline</b>
                                </br>All delegates will be required to follow the <a href="http://www.ebnet.org/files/filesystem/ebhs%20student%20handbook%20-%202014-2015.pdf" target="_blank">East Brunswick High School Student Handbook Code of Conduct</a>, and those who do not do so will be asked to leave the conference. Enforcement of these rules will be strict and the conference will have the discretion to remove people from committee and ask them to leave.
                            </p>

                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Technology </b>
                                </br>In order to ensure a fair and educational committee experience, all forms of mobile technology will be excluded from the conference, including laptops, tablets, and cell phones. Should delegates require information, they are encouraged to ask their dais for assistance. The only exception to this rule will be in the European Commission and Indian Cabinet committees, where they are allowed at the discretion of the chairs. However, we stress that they are not necessary and those delegates without such technology will not be at any disadvantage whatsoever. 
                            </p>

                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Rules &amp; Procedures</b>
                                </br>All delegates are required to be individual delegations, no double delegations are allowed. Position papers are required to be emailed to chairs or handed in at the beginning of committee in order to be eligible for awards.These papers should be at least a page in length (double spaced) and describe the background of the issue, your country's viewpoint, and possible solutions. Delegates are expected to adhere to country policy and should make the best effort to represent their given policy. Inability to do so may result in consequences at the discretion of the chair. EBMUNC will use standard Model UN procedure, derived off of those rules at RUMUN, NAIMUN, and NHSMUN. Special thanks to these conferences for their guides, and our rules can be found below! 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Refreshments</b>
                                </br>The conference will provide pizza and water free of charge to all delegates for lunch. We request that attendees contact the conference as soon as they receive their assignments with an estimated count of slices they would like to order. Since lunch will be served in committee, we would like to be as precise as possible in our estimates. Soft drinks, snacks, and baked goods will be sold throughout the day for delegates and moderators. We encourage you to take advantage of this and treat yourself!
                            </p>

                            <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
                                <b>Awards</b>
                                </br>As EBMUNC and its staff believes that Model UN is primarily an educational experience, we would like to de-emphasize awards. However, we recognize that the Model UN community looks favorably on awards, and therefore will reward excellent delegates based on speaking ability, ideas and research, leadership, participation, ability to compromise, and other qualities. Position papers are required for awards eligibility. We will hand out Distinguished Delegate, Outstanding Delegate, and Best Delegate awards. Awards will be at the discretion of the dais, and we discourage delegates from trying to seek out awards. Only individual delegates will be recognized, we will not give out school awards. 
                            </p>
