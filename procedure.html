                                </br>Be on time for roll call, which is taken at the start of EACH committee session. If you’re late, send a note to the dais to let them know of your presence, since it affects voting calculations.

                                </br>Speaker’s List time runs from one to two minutes. The Chair says, “Motion to set the speaking time at 90 seconds.” Requires two speakers for and two against with a 30-second speaking time. Requires a simple majority to pass.
                                </br><i style="text-decoration:underline;">The Speaker's List:</i>

                                </br>A yield is a way to handle remaining speaking time (Ex. the speaking time is one minute, but the delegate only speaks for thirty seconds). Yields can only be made when delegates are called from the Speaker’s List, and must be specified before a delegate begins speaking. If the delegate fails to specify a yield, the yield is defaulted to the Chair (See A).
                                </br>A. “I yield my time to the Chair.” - Remaining time is unused
                                </br>B. “I yield my time to questions.” - Chair will call on a delegate to ask the speaker a question. Speaker can only respond for the amount of time unused. No back-and-forth-dialouge between delegates!

                                </br>The moderated caucus allows countries that are low on the Speaker’s List to have the opportunity to speak by temporarily suspending the Speaker’s List and allowing the chair to call on countries at their discretion. The delegate who proposed the caucus should specify the topic of discussion, specify the duration (not to exceed 20 minutes, and speaking time per delegate. To signal your desire to speak, simply raise your placard. Delegates should remain in their seats during a moderated caucus and maintain decorum, as during formal debate.
                                </br>SAY: “Motion for a ten-minute moderated caucus with 30-second speaking times [for the purpose of discussing __________________].”
                                </br><i style="text-decoration:underline;">Unmoderated Caucus:</i>
                                </br>A motion for an unmoderated caucus, which requires a majority to pass, allows the suspension of the rules and of formal debate. Delegates may leave their seats and discuss topics freely. The delegate making the motion must specify a total time for the proposed caucus, not to exceed 20 minutes. The Chair reserves the right to rule such a motion out of order. This is an ideal time to draft resolutions and develop relationships with fellow countries.
                                </br>SAY: “Motion for a ten-minute unmoderated caucus.”
